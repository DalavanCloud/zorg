TODO

This is a TODO list of major and minor features for LNT.

Major Features
--------------

Too many to name!

Minor Features
--------------

Optimize test distribution format for common cases.

 1. We should left the test info higher in the format, so that it can easily be
 shared by a large number of samples.

 2. We should specify test samples in an array instead of objects, to avoid
 requiring repetitive 'Name' and 'Data' keys.

 3. We should support [test, sample] in addition to [test, [sample, ...]].

These changes would significantly compact the archive format, which improves
performance across the board.
